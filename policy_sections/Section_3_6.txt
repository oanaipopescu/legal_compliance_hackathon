3.6 Information security incident categorization 
The incident management system in which information security incidents are registered must have the option to flag an information security incident as such.
It must be possible to apply one of the following categories to an information security incident:
o Malware;
o Social Engineering;
o Hacking and Attacks;
o Error;
o Misuse;
o Physical.
Dependent on the sensitivity of the information security incident it must be possible to restrict access on a need-to-know basis, e.g. on departmental or named basis.
