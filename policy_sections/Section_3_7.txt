3.7 Information security incident prioritization 
Information security incidents must be assigned a severity level, i.e. high, medium, or low, based on functional impact, information impact, and recoverability effort, to determine prioritization.
The severity level and prioritization can be determined by applying the table below. For determining the severity only one of the properties have to be met.
1.	Severity: High 
Properties: 
• Functional Impact: some (critical) services cannot be delivered to any users and 10 or more users or assets are affected. 
• Information Impact: confidentiality or integrity compromised of Secret Classified information. 
• Recoverability Effort: recovery from the incident is not possible and time to recover is unpredictable and additional resources and external expertise might be needed. 
• Response Time: Immediate
2.	Severity: Medium 
• Functional Impact: some (critical) services cannot be delivered to any users and 5 to 10 users or assets are affected. 
• Information Impact: confidentiality or integrity compromised of Confidential Classified information. 
• Recoverability Effort: time to recover is predictable and additional resources might be needed. 
• Response Time: 1 hour 
3.	Severity Low: 
• Functional Impact: all (critical) services can still be delivered but with lost efficiency and less than 5 users or assets are affected. 
• Information Impact: confidentiality or integrity compromised of Internal Classified information.  
• Recoverability Effort: time to recover is predictable with existing resources.
• Response time: 2 hours
