2.7 Collection of Evidence 
To the extent required, it is important that Signify ensures the collection of admissible and complete evidence for any security incident that takes place for the purposes of disciplinary and legal action in strict coordination with the Legal Department. Local Operation Procedures shall be established for the identification, collection, acquisition and preservation of evidence in accordance with different types of media to maintain a chain of custody and safety of data, personnel, assets and evidence. 
The requirements of different jurisdictions and countries must be considered when developing these Local Operation Procedures in order to maximize chances of admission of the evidence across different nations and to validate whether such process is permissible in the specific country.
